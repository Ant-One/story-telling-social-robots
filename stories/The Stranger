Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.
I got a telegram from the home: "Mother deceased .
Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours." That doesn't mean
anything. Maybe it was yesterday.
The old people's home is at Marengo, about eighty
kilometers from Algiers, I'll take the two o'clock bus and
get there in the afternoon. That way I can be there for the
vigil and come back tomorrow night. I asked my boss for
two days off and there was no way he was going to refuse me with an excuse like that. But he wasn't too happy about it.
