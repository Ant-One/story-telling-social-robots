Once upon a time in a beautiful country, there was a vernal event: the springtime flower show. Here, all along the main boulevard, dozens of beautiful blossoms had taken up residence on the branches of the trees. Every year, people from all over the land traveled there, bringing their floral tiaras along. When the King and Queen entered the palace, the nobles bowed their heads and offered up praise, then bowed low before the king and queen and knelt to receive their homage. The King and Queen then led the nobles one by one onto the dais and presented them with gifts and a large sum.
