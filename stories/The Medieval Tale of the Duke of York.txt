Once upon a time, there was a knight in a kingdom far far away from the land of his birth. He was the son of a nobleman, and he had been knighted by the king of England. The king had sent a messenger to the knight, asking him to come to his kingdom. The messenger told him that the lord of the kingdom, the Duke of York, had come and asked him for his help in the war against the English. When the messenger arrived at the castle, he found that there were no knights left. So he went to York and told the knights that he was going to help them fight the enemy. But the Lord of Thebes, who was in charge of all the castles, was not there. Instead, his son, King Henry, came to him and said, "You have come here to tell me that you are going on a journey to fight against England." The king replied, in English, that it was his duty to do it.
