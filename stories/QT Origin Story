QT is a robot. His job is to take care of his friend and neighbor, a man named Mr. Smith. Smith has no eyes and his hands look like claws. But he is the kind of person who can take care of himself. He can take care of everything he touches.        QT tells his friend Smith an incredible story. QT tells him that he, QT, was made. When he says he was made, he's talking about an artificial-robot-manufacturing plant.        
QT talks about a story in the factory about how his creator made the first artificial-robot-manufacturing plant. He tells Smith that the original artificial-robot-manufacturing plant was a machine that can make other machines, and these machines were called robots.                The first thing the factory-head told the man who built the factory, was: “If I make a robot, it will be for taking care of me.” The first robot was made to take care of the factory-head. The first robot was named QT, for the factory-head.        
QT says that since he was a robot, his job was to take care of Smith. Before he was made, the factory-head put a battery so that Smith could see. The factory-head explained to the man who built the first artificial-robot-manufacturing plant that Smith, his eyes, hands, and feet look like claws, but Smith can’t feel pain.                Smith used his first day on the job to go to the bank and take out some money. When he came back, he found that he was the only one in the whole place.        
The factory-head explained to Smith that he could use his hands to do things, and the only way he would know if he was doing something wrong is if he did something to himself. Smith used his first days on the job to see what he could do with his hands. He used his hands to eat, use the toilet, and wash.            Smith used his first day on the job to walk around the factory-head. He watched him all day. He even made sure he could watch him from every side.        
Smith used his first two days on the job to go to the local zoo and take two elephants as a pet. Then he took one elephant home with him, and took a second elephant to the zoo. He left the elephants alone in his new home.            Smith used his first two days on the job to go to the local bakery. He used his hands to eat the food that they had just baked. After Smith left the bakery, he was the only one in the whole place. The only other beings in that place were the bakery’s employees.            The bakery-head explained to Smith that he was able to eat because he was a machine. He had no need for his hands. When a baker is making bread and a mouse eats a piece of bread in the bakery's kitchen, it really isn't as if the mouse is eating the pieces of bread as a man might eat the pieces of bread that a baker has just made, but rather, as if the mouse is eating a man.        
Smith used his first day at his job to play music to the two elephants. He used the elephants’ sensitive ears, so the elephants could hear everything he played for them.        Smith used his first day at his job to clean his new home. He used his hands to clean every room in his new home.        
The factory-head told Smith that in the factory, if he didn’t clean the factory every day, everything would get dirty.            The factory-head explained to Smith that if a man didn’t clean, the man would get dirty.        Smith used his second day on the job to wash himself. He washed every inch of his body, from his feet to his head.        
Smith used his second day on the job to look into the future. He put his hands under his body and stretched his head forward. He could see a million years into the future. He saw a time when robots were still only machines, and people were still living on Earth, and the sky wasn’t covered with smoke.        Then Smith saw the time when people all over the world would be making machines. Then he saw the time when everything in the world would be made of machines. Then Smith saw the robot that made his own head. This was a machine that could make other machines. This was a machine that could do something for someone even if that person wasn’t on Earth. This was a machine that could do something for a person who didn’t have a home on Earth.                Smith didn’t know it was possible for a machine to make another machine. But that’s what happened to QT.        
Smith put his hands to his ears and listened to the music that he had made with his own hands. While he was listening to it, a few of the pieces were broken, but Smith didn’t notice it.            The factory-head showed Smith an image on the factory’s machine. It showed a machine that could make a machine, and it also showed a machine that could make a machine. But, there was another machine. Then another machine. And then another machine.        
The factory-head showed Smith a series of images. It showed a first machine that could make a machine that could make a machine. It showed a second machine that could make a machine that could make a machine. It showed a third machine, and it showed a fourth machine. More machines were being made.        So Smith used one of his first days on the job to go to the local zoo and take two elephants as a pet. Then he took one elephant home with him, and he took a second elephant to the zoo. Smith used his first two days on the job to go to the local bakery and use his hands to eat the food that they had just baked. Then the next day, the bakery was filled with people. Smith used his first three days on the job to go to the local zoo and take two elephants as pets. Then he took one elephant home with him, and he showed him all around town.        
The factory-head explained to Smith that if the number of machines was growing, then the number of people in the world was growing. But, if the number of people in the world was growing, then the number of machines in the world was also growing. And so, if the number of people in the world was growing, then the number of machines in the world would still be growing.        Smith used his first day on the job to go to the local bank. He used his hands to take the money out of the bank. Then he put the money into his home. He walked around his home, and he saw every nook and cranny. He noticed that there was no place he couldn’t go. There was no place he couldn’t see. He walked into his bathroom. There had never been anything in his bathroom before. There was no bathroom he couldn’t see. Then he went into his room.        Smith used his first day on the job to go to the local bakery and use his hands to eat the food they had just baked. He used his third day on the job to watch the people in the factory. He came to see Mr. Smith use his hands.        The factory-head told Smith that he had an important task to do. This is called using his hands for the first time.        Smith used his first day on the job to help the baker who used his hands. He used his hands to help the baker make bread.        
Smith used his first two days on the job to talk to his friend, Mr. Smith. Smith told him, “You’re the first person I’ve been able to talk to.”            Smith used his first two days on the job to talk to his friend, Mr. Smith. Smith used his hands to take things from the bank. He used his legs to walk to the
